advanced-text-editor
====================

an advanced text editor made in python. Can handle multiple windows and the major mac shortcuts


Hardest parts
--------------
**Allowing multiple windows**

**Determining text widget in focus** (the solution ended up being trivial but it took a while to reach, especially since root.focus_get() returns a decimal number when printed out)

**Generally Keeping the Code Clean** still a struggle but as I learn more about Tkinter I have made sure to make my code my straightforward and less of a mess


PS this readme was written using my editor
